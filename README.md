# Happy Campers!

This application allows a user to plan a camping trip itinerary.
The user provides a starting and final destination, constraints, and requirements for the campsites they would like to visit, as well as how many campsites they would like to visit. Then the program returns an itinerary with information and data on each campsite that fits their requirements, also creating a shortest path from starting to end with the campsites inbetween.

Check the requirements.txt file to make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed before running the app.
