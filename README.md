# happy-campers

This application allows a user to plan a camping trip itinerary.
The user provides a starting and final destination, constraints and requirements for the campsites they would like to visit, and how many campsites they would like to visit. Then the program returns an itinerary with information and data on each campsite that fits their requirements, also creating a shortest path from starting to end with the campsites inbetween.
